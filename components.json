Origin is the place the CDN fetches the original files from (e.g., your S3 bucket or your Netlify storage). The CDN caches those files. A Domain Name System converts example.com to the host address. You add records at your domain registrar to point the name to your host (CNAME, A, ALIAS/ANAME). TLS / HTTPS encrypts traffic.

MIME types / Content-Type tells the browser what kind of file it’s receiving (text/html, text/css, application/javascript), so the browser handles it correctly. SPA routing fallback brings single-page apps use client-side routes (e.g., /profile/123). The server should return index.html for unknown paths so the client app can decide what to render. Origin Access / Private buckets instead of making the storage bucket public, you can keep it private and allow only the CDN to fetch objects more secure. Build step if you use frameworks (React/Vue/Next/Eleventy), a build step compiles source files into static files (dist/) that you upload. Minification & compression minify CSS/JS to reduce size.
